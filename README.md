# UFOs

# Overview of Project
This project is to retrieve UFO sightings data to build a functional table and to add the ability to filter the data on multiple criteria as input. In this research, JavaScript and html coding was used to achieve the web functions.

# Results
The index.html file was modified to create multiple table filters for the datetime, city, state, country, and shape as shown in the image below. The JavaScript file was developed incorporating a function that saves the element, value and filter id that was changed, as well as another function to loop through the dataset keeping only the data that matches searching criteria. 

![Multi_filters](https://github.com/hankai26/UFOs/blob/main/Resources/Multi_filters.png);

If any specific criteria were input in the web, for example, typing " " in the filter id of "city", a filter variable was created to store the information.




Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

There is a description of how to perform a search, with images.
